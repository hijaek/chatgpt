Chatgpt Projects:

1) Test - I will play around with Chatgpt in this test folder to test connections, explore different connection parameters, and possibly set up a quick chatbot.

2) Math Problem Solver - This app allows users to upload a photo of a math problem, which will be converted to text. Chatgpt will then solve and explain the problem. 
Image-to-text capability will be available in Chatgpt4.

3) Meeting Summarizer - This app converts meetings and videos to text files using speech-to-text technology. Chatgpt will then summarize their contents. Generating footnotes (or links) for nomenclatures and scholarly references would be a cool feature too. 
OpenAI already provides speech-to-text:Â https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/speech-to-text
